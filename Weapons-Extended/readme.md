## Steam Workshop description

Papa Bizz's NF Weapons Extended is a mod that delivers additional whacking, banging, thumping and ouchy-causing instruments to the game.

The mod is a continuous piece of work and ultimately, it's just a bit of fun. I'm trying to deliver something which can be installed no questions asked too - so please let me know if you get a mod conflict and i'll work to resolve it without faff.

Think about it, if you needed to punch someone in a primitive environment. You'd make it count by clubbing them with a rock, right?
